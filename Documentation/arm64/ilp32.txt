ILP32 AARCH64 SYSCALL ABI
=========================

This document describes the ILP32 syscall ABI and where it differs
from the generic compat linux syscall interface.

Syscalls which normally would pass 64bit values as two arguments;
now pass the 64bit value as one argument.

struct rt_sigframe is redefined and contains struct compat_siginfo,
as compat syscalls expects, and struct sigframe, taken from lp64 to
handle AARCH64 register set.
